This tool queries the [national weather service](https://weather-gov.github.io/api/general-faqs) to get current forecast for your current location.

Your location is determined by based on ip address geolocation via [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/) and then passed to weather service API to get your forecasting area.

Note that using a VPN may skew the results. You can use the `-location` switch to check what location you are getting the forecast for. There is currently no way to specify a location.

    Usage:
      -version
            display version number and exit
      -location
            show the location of the forecast
      -week
            show the forecast for the entire week

Use the `-week` switch to show forecast for the entire week.
