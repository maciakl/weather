# ðŸŒ¤ weather

Show weather forecast on the command line.

This tool queries the [National Weather Service](https://weather-gov.github.io/api/general-faqs) to get current forecast for your current location.

âš  Note: internet connection required.

By default, your location is determined by based on ip address geolocation via [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/) and then passed to weather service API to get your forecasting area.

Note that using a VPN may skew the results.

You can override this behavior, by using the `-zip` switch and providing a US zip code to see a forecast for that specific location. In that case, your geographical location will be determined via [Zipppopotam.us](https://api.zippopotam.us/) API instead.

You can use the `-location` switch to check what location of forecast. Please note that the `-location` displays your forecast area returned by the National Weather Service API based on your latitude and longtitude. The forcast areas are sometimes larger than a zip codes, so you may not always see your exact town name displayed -- this is normal.
